# Mapping_Earthquakes
The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. A URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website is used to retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. JavaScript and D3.js library are used to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. Leaflet library is used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
